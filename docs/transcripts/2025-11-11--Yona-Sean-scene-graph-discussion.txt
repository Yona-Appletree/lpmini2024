[00:00.000 --> 00:02.440]  Please go ahead. Summarize.
[00:03.500 --> 00:08.720]  Summary of the LightPlayer scene graph node types.
[00:09.140 --> 00:24.880]  So there are input nodes, which represent user interface elements or input devices like buttons and sliders, color pickers, audio input, potentially cameras, anything like that.
[00:24.880 --> 00:45.620]  Then there are the image nodes or the effect nodes that do processing of images, kind of the internal ones, which could be the effect pipeline, which has a series of steps that does things, you know, contrast changes.
[00:45.620 --> 00:51.340]  It's very similar to the CSS filter. It's actually a really good example of a pipeline of a filter effects.
[00:51.960 --> 00:53.880]  It's essentially a CSS filter property.
[00:54.880 --> 01:06.000]  But it could also be a fluid simulation or a cellular automata or some other form of stateful fire simulation or something like that that has state.
[01:07.100 --> 01:10.800]  Specifically, the pipeline nodes don't have state.
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.280]  They are just a series of filters.
[01:15.020 --> 01:21.840]  And then the other type of node we haven't talked too much about are the kind of math nodes.
[01:23.600 --> 01:24.780]  Maybe even in the same.
[01:24.880 --> 01:27.460]  I don't know the category, but like a low frequency oscillator.
[01:30.060 --> 01:30.840]  There might be others.
[01:30.840 --> 01:32.160]  That's the one that comes to mind.
[01:32.160 --> 01:32.860]  Mind.
[01:34.560 --> 01:38.360]  Stateful drivers of data.
[01:39.360 --> 01:45.700]  And then we talked about the concept of a module, which is a collection of nodes.
[01:46.400 --> 01:49.000]  And there's probably going to be different types of modules.
[01:49.760 --> 01:54.100]  The most notable one will be the effect module, which is a collection of what we were just talking about.
[01:54.100 --> 02:00.280]  They go together that have some set of inputs and produce an image.
[02:00.280 --> 02:03.160]  That's what's really fundamental about an effect module.
[02:03.160 --> 02:13.620]  It produces an image and potentially some other metadata as outputs, like its priority and whether or not it has anything to do currently has user input.
[02:14.620 --> 02:16.140]  That's essentially the effect system.
[02:16.140 --> 02:20.140]  If we're thinking from left to right in the scene graph, that's the left part.
[02:21.080 --> 02:23.620]  Then you critically have the muxing system.
[02:24.100 --> 02:32.100]  Which is what takes many image inputs and many effects inputs really.
[02:33.020 --> 02:38.220]  And picks which one to use at the current time.
[02:39.320 --> 02:51.760]  And these mux nodes could come in various varieties, but the obvious two are some sort of timeline where you sort of iterate through different effects on a schedule.
[02:52.620 --> 02:53.940]  And then one that is selected.
[02:54.100 --> 02:59.260]  The most interesting for user input, select the effect that has the most interesting user input right now.
[03:00.160 --> 03:06.580]  And so if you touch the button or something, the pattern would change and do something so long as you're interacting with it.
[03:07.300 --> 03:12.880]  And then one further step to the right is the fixture node.
[03:13.880 --> 03:17.720]  Which conceptually at least takes the image output.
[03:17.720 --> 03:23.900]  They take as input an image and they sample that image for.
[03:24.100 --> 03:26.100]  The pixels that they care about.
[03:26.100 --> 03:29.260]  And then they produce as output.
[03:29.260 --> 03:33.040]  One dimensional color data.
[03:33.040 --> 03:40.880]  Which is critically includes the color mapping to the type of LED they are.
[03:40.880 --> 03:49.420]  So if they're RGB LED or if they're like, you know, RGBA or RGBW or GRB.
[03:49.420 --> 03:51.420]  The fixtures handle all of that.
[03:51.420 --> 03:52.820]  They handle taking an image.
[03:52.820 --> 03:53.900]  And converting it into a color.
[03:53.900 --> 03:54.000]  And then they take the image and they sample it.
[03:54.000 --> 03:54.080]  And then they take the image and they sample it.
[03:54.080 --> 03:59.820]  So a list of numbers that can be sent out to the final type of node.
[03:59.820 --> 04:00.920]  Which is an output node.
[04:03.700 --> 04:06.800]  Which there's some question as to whether or not we even need output nodes.
[04:07.900 --> 04:10.240]  They might just be part of the scene config itself.
[04:10.240 --> 04:10.920]  But for now.
[04:11.880 --> 04:12.500]  An output.
[04:13.320 --> 04:14.220]  The output stage.
[04:15.220 --> 04:16.700]  Would be something like.
[04:18.780 --> 04:23.980]  A WS2811 on output on pin GPIO.
[04:23.980 --> 04:33.280]  pin 5, or it could be something like an ARTnet output
[04:33.280 --> 04:35.980]  to a particular host and port with a particular number
[04:35.980 --> 04:38.380]  of universes and channels.
[04:38.380 --> 04:40.160]  But fundamentally, it represents some way
[04:40.160 --> 04:42.880]  of getting data out of the system.
[04:42.880 --> 04:46.840]  And its input is a series of what are basically
[04:46.840 --> 04:53.960]  slices of binary data, which we don't need to go too deep
[04:53.980 --> 05:00.980]  into, but essentially a piece of binary data
[05:00.980 --> 05:04.380]  that also has an offset of where it goes, right?
[05:04.380 --> 05:08.100]  Because the output, the fixtures aren't necessarily
[05:08.100 --> 05:09.360]  going to take an entire output.
[05:09.360 --> 05:12.680]  So the fixture might say, starting at LED 100,
[05:12.680 --> 05:15.220]  50 LEDs worth of data.
[05:15.220 --> 05:17.660]  And that goes into the output, which sends it ultimately
[05:17.660 --> 05:18.160]  onward.
[05:20.940 --> 05:21.540]  Right.
[05:21.540 --> 05:23.340]  And one thing I wanted to say on the module,
[05:23.340 --> 05:23.940]  because they're big.
[05:23.940 --> 05:23.960]  Right.
[05:23.960 --> 05:23.980]  Right.
[05:23.980 --> 05:25.700]  There are other types that we discussed.
[05:25.700 --> 05:27.800]  Like if your module only has fixtures,
[05:27.800 --> 05:29.460]  it might be a hardware config module.
[05:29.460 --> 05:37.160]  If it only has rendering, like you said, it's a pattern type.
[05:37.160 --> 05:38.580]  There are effects.
[05:38.580 --> 05:39.500]  Effect type, thank you.
[05:39.500 --> 05:40.080]  Yeah.
[05:40.080 --> 05:43.120]  So the two other types there.
[05:43.120 --> 05:46.360]  And there might be the types of modules
[05:46.360 --> 05:48.660]  are not fully thought through yet.
[05:48.660 --> 05:52.420]  We definitely know effect modules.
[05:52.420 --> 05:53.960]  Very likely, fixtures can be.
[05:53.960 --> 05:57.460]  They might be arranged into modules because you might have,
[05:57.460 --> 06:02.800]  say, the dome is made up of 10 control boxes.
[06:02.800 --> 06:05.740]  It would probably make sense to have a module
[06:05.740 --> 06:07.880]  with those fixtures in it.
[06:07.880 --> 06:12.340]  It might also frequently be sensible to put outputs
[06:12.340 --> 06:17.140]  and fixtures together in a module.
[06:17.140 --> 06:19.680]  That would actually probably make a lot of sense in many cases.
[06:19.680 --> 06:23.940]  So like if you had a.
[06:23.960 --> 06:28.460]  Like in the DMX world and the stage lighting systems,
[06:28.460 --> 06:33.920]  you might put the output device, which is like send data
[06:33.920 --> 06:37.200]  to a particular ARTnet receiver.
[06:37.200 --> 06:38.920]  And then it's a collection of fixtures
[06:38.920 --> 06:40.580]  that all send to that same one.
[06:40.580 --> 06:44.820]  And that whole thing, that whole concept is a module.
[06:44.820 --> 06:48.120]  In fact, in that sense, the dome might just be one module.
[06:48.120 --> 06:49.240]  Right.
[06:49.240 --> 06:52.640]  The hardware can, because they're related to each other.
[06:52.640 --> 06:53.140]  Yeah.
[06:53.140 --> 06:53.940]  The shape.
[06:53.960 --> 06:54.560]  The shape.
[06:54.560 --> 06:55.340]  And the outputs are related.
[06:55.340 --> 06:57.340]  So those are some concepts of modules.
[06:57.340 --> 07:01.960]  Okay. I'm going to, if that's all for the recap,
[07:01.960 --> 07:06.080]  I'm going to call the recording just so we don't get too messy.
[07:06.080 --> 07:08.280]  Yep. Correct.
