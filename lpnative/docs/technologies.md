## Rust

Rust is the primary language for the core engine of lightplayer.

It is chosen because:

- it can **scale** from a single core microcontroller with limited memory
  to a many-core sever with gigabytes of memory.
- emphasizes **correctness** with its type system, ownership model,
  and built-in testing

## Svelte

Svelte is used for the web frontend.

## TOML

Toml is used for configuration because it is **simple** and well supported
in the rust ecosystem.
