# Light Player Mini

Light Player Mini, or `lpmini` for short, is an early stage project for controlling addressable
leds using cheap microcontrollers like the ESP32c3.

It is primarily implemented in Rust using `esp-hal` and `embassy`.

Project goals include:

- Ease of use for non-technical users
- Scalability from micro-controllers to desktop machines with GPUs
- Live editing of visualizations
